## Details on Delegator Working Process

1. The Delegator comes up with the Cairo Program and creates the Job Header and Job Body, sending them to the peer-to-peer network.
2. If they have enough funds in the Registry and they place an attractive offer, the task will be picked up.
3. After broadcasting the Job Header, they listen for the events from the Registry to receive the verified Job Witness they pay for.
